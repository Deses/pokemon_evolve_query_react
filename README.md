Tiny React app (found [here](https://pokemon-evolve-query.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku) made using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to generate queries for mass-evolving Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Run locally with `npm start`. Supports both application and CSS hot-reloading by default.
